  <p>Hello there! It's that time of the year again. Last year, I told myself to start this habit of summarizing how my year went and I shall give you that. Here's to a year in review of my 2020 😀 A surprising year for everyone. COVID says hi. 😀</p>
  
  <p>Yes, I'm a bit delayed but better late than never. This time around, I will follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERGbgvvCJ8o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ali Abdaal's Anti-Wasteman System</a> for my Year 2020 Annual Review. Love how intricate and practical it is. I made this last January but need to cut out some private stuff if I were to post it here!</p>

  <p><strong>HERE WE GO! Let's start…</strong></p>

  <h2>💭 Reflections</h2>

  <p>2020 was a year of unexpected challenges and blessings. The pandemic changed everything, but it also taught me valuable lessons about resilience, gratitude, and the importance of meaningful connections.</p>

  <p>Despite the canceled travel plans and health scares, I found joy in the small things – family time, team collaboration, and personal growth. The year reminded me that life is unpredictable, but our response to it is what truly matters.</p>

  <p>Looking back, I'm grateful for the people who stood by me, the experiences that shaped me, and the strength I discovered within myself.</p>
