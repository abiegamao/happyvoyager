  <p>But if you want to save the relationship (which you should always do), did you know that there is a better way to do it?</p>
  
  <p>I want to be reminded of this myself. Very much.</p>

  <h2>🗣️ The Confrontation Principle</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Caring for people should precede confronting people.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Conflict is like cancer. Early detection increases the possibility of a healthy outcome.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>50% of the time people don't realize there is a problem.</li>
    <li>30% know there is, but don't know how to solve it.</li>
    <li>20% know, but don't want to solve it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>☑️ The Good News:</strong> 80% of the time conflict is solvable.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Did you know that conflict compounds when confrontation is not done quickly and correctly?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>⚠️ Harmful Strategies</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Win at all costs 🏆</strong> – You care more about winning the argument more than winning the person.</li>
    <li><strong>Pretend it doesn't exist 🌀</strong> – Builds up resentment and pain cycles</li>
    <li><strong>Whine about it</strong> – Playing Victim</li>
    <li><strong>Keep score</strong> – "Get even" mentality. Reliving past mistakes</li>
    <li><strong>Pull rank</strong> – Using position</li>
    <li><strong>White flag it 🏳️</strong> – Quitting is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>✅ Healthy Confrontation</h3>

  <h4>1. Confront only if you care for that person</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep their interests in mind. Make it a WIN for both parties.</li>
    <li>They MUST know you care about them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Meet Together ASAP</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Over time, it will get worse.</li>
    <li>Why? If people are put in a position to start speculating about another person's motives or to try to figure out what might have really happened, they often think the worst. 😢 <em>human nature</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Seek Understanding first, not necessarily agreement</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Lincoln way: Think about 1/3 – You, 2/3 – Them</li>
    <li>You can't reach understanding if your focus is yourself.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The person who gives an opinion before he understands is human, but the person who gives a judgement before he understand is a fool.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4>4. Outline the Issue</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Describe your perceptions</strong> – Stay away from conclusions and/or statements about the person's motives. WAG MUNA MAG ASSUME. OR MAGING NEGA. Just tell what you see or describe the problem you think is causing.</li>
    <li><strong>Tell how this makes you feel</strong> – Express clearly and WITHOUT accusation.</li>
    <li><strong>Explain why this is important to you</strong> – Hopefully, he/she will make it a priority of what you value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Encourage a genuine response</h4>
  <p>If they don't have their say, they won't be able to move toward a resolution to the problem. They will be focused on their response that they can't hear anything else.</p>

  <h4>6. Agree to an Action Plan</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear Identification of the Issue</li>
    <li>Agreement to solve the issue</li>
    <li>Concrete steps that demonstrate the issue has been resolved</li>
    <li>An accountability structure</li>
    <li>Deadline for completion</li>
    <li>Commitment by both parties to put the issue in the past once resolved.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Measure of Success</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>✅ <strong>Positive Change</strong></li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Relationship growth</strong> – The conflict you had just made your relationship stronger! 💪 A dramatic turn of event</li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"If you would win a man to your cause, ✅ first convince him that you are his sincere friend. ❌ Assume to dictate his judgement, or to command his action, or to mark him to be shunned/despised, and he will retreat within himself."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Last words…</h3>
  <p>I realized how lacking or wrong my confrontations had been, and it now made sense why it wasn't totally resolved or ended up getting worse. A lot of golden nuggets can be taken from this book which is why I recommend YOU reading this. Right NOW!</p>

  <p>I wished I had read this sooner and master its concepts. It could've saved me a lot of unnecessary pain!</p>

  <p>The good news is, it's not yet too late for us! As long as we are still alive, we can still save and improve our relationships.</p>

  <p>And yes, I think I will be posting more of my book notes more than travels for now. Especially now. Other things I am passionate about is self-development and taking notes out of it. As a person, I still have a lot to improve. Learning never stops.</p>

  <p>I hope you stick around, and let's learn together! 😀</p>
