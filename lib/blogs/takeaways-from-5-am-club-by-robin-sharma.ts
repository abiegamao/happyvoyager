  <p>Below are my notes reading the 5-3-1 Creed of the 5 am club by Robin Sharma.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is in the moment that you face your deepest weakness that you receive the chance to forge your greatest strengths. Real power, then comes not from the life of ease but one of intense effort, devoted discipline & demanding action in direction of what your supreme self knows to be right.</p>

  <h2>The 5-3-1 Creed of Willpower Warrior</h2>

  <h3>5 scientific truths behind excellent habits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Truth #1:</strong> World-class will power isn't an inborn strength, but a skill developed through relentless practice. Getting up at dawn is a perfect self-control training.</li>
    <li><strong>Truth #2:</strong> Personal Discipline is a muscle. The more you stretch it, the stronger it grows. Therefore, the samurai of self-regulation actively create conditions of hardship to build their natural power.</li>
    <li><strong>Truth #3:</strong> Like other muscles, willpower weakens when tired. Recovery is absolutely necessary for the expression of mastery. And to manage decision fatigue.</li>
    <li><strong>Truth #4:</strong> Installing any great habit successfully follows a distinct 4 part pattern for automation of the routine. Follow it explicitly!</li>
    <li><strong>Truth #5:</strong> Increasing self-control in one area of your life elevates self-control in all areas of your life.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3 Values of Heroic Habit-Makers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>#1</strong> Victory demands consistency & persistence.</li>
    <li><strong>#2</strong> Following through on what is started determines the size of the personal respect that will be generated.</li>
    <li><strong>#3</strong> The way you practice in private is precisely the way you'll perform once you're in public.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>To regularly do what is hard, but important when it feels most uncomfortable is how warriors are born.</em></p>

  <h2>Key Insights</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Ambition without implementation is a ridiculous delusion.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The common denominator of success → formed the habit of doing things that failures don't like to do.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Stay committed no matter what!</p>

  <p>Those who habituated a battle-proof morning routine to defend their gifts, cultivated a heroic personal constraint, and developed a bulletproof character → Times ahead will be rich, harmonious, and ultra-productive!</p>

  <p><strong>Neglect your power long enough & you'll eventually believe you don't have any.</strong></p>

  <h3>Neuroplasticity & GRIT</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> – our brains grow throughout our lives. The more we practice a habit, the more our brain will work for us and evolve to make it who we are.</p>

  <p><strong>GRIT</strong> – high level of commitment, discipline, resilience + perseverance.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  
  <p>The 5 AM Club teaches us that real transformation happens through consistent daily practices. By mastering our mornings, we master our lives. The discipline to wake up early and dedicate time to personal growth compounds over time, leading to extraordinary results.</p>

  <p>Remember: your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. Choose wisely and commit fully.</p>
